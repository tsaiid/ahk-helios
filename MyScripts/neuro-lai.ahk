Previous MRI of brain: none

FINDINGS:
A 1.8 x 0.9 x 2.2 cm cystic mass lesion, arising from the sella, with snowman configuration, shows some enhanced component at the periphery, c/w pituitary macroadenoma.
The lesion shows blood-fluid level, suggestive of previous or recent hemorrhagic or cystic transformation. Pituitary apoplexy may also be considered if an acute clinical symptom presents. Suggest compare with previous images from other institute.

No evidence of high signal intensity on DWI and lower apparent diffusion coefficient suggesting acute ischemia infarction in the brain and brainstem noted.

The bilateral lateral ventricles showed symmetrical without dilatation.

The major dural venous sinuses are patent.

The visible paranasal sinuses, mastoids and skull base are unremarkable.

MRA shows several suspicious aneurysms at the right supraclinoid ICA, size up to 2.7 mm. Suggest correlate with DSA.
