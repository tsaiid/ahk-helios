FINDINGS:
A gravid uterus with abnormally low position of the placenta, completely covering the internal cervical os, c/w placenta previa, grade IV (complete placenta previa).

T2 HASTE and true FISP images show
- Heterogeneous signal intensity in the placenta
- Abnormal intraplacental dark bands
- Abnormal dilated intraplacental vascularity
- Focal thinning of myometrium
- Loss of triple-layered appearance of normal myometrium
at the lower anterior uterine segment, c/w placenta accreta. Suggest correlation with placental sonography and clinical history.

The fetus is in vertex presentation, and the images show no hydrocephalus, no hydronephrosis, and no obvious structural anomaly.
The amniotic fluid volume is within normal limits.


REF:
Imaging findings of PA, Cardinal signs
- Dark intraplacental bands on T2-weighted images
- Heterogeneity within the placenta
- Abnormal disorganized placental vascularity
- Others â€“ less sensitive signs
- Uterine bulging
- Focal interruptions of the myometrial wall (high specificity for increta and percreta)
- Tenting of urinary bladder (highly specific for percreta)

- Irregular dark bands on T2 HASTE images showing decreased signal on true FISP images, representing abnormal fibrin deposition;
- Dilated tortuous signal voids on T2 HASTE images deep within the placenta showing increased signal on true FISP images, which is indicative of abnormal vascular lacunae.


Key imaging features of normal placentation
- Homogeneous T2-intermediate signal intensity of placenta
- Subtle thin, regularly spaced placental septi
- Normal subplacental vascularity
- Triple-layered sandwich appearance of myometrium
- Pear-shape of normal gravid uterus with smooth contour.
