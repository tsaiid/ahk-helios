Embolization was performed with Glue (NBCA/lipiodol = 1:4).
The follow-up GDA and SMA angiography showed no more active bleeding.
The sheath will be kept for 24 hours for use if other bleeding episode occurs.

The angiography of celiac trunk, followed by gastroduodenal artery, showed active bleeding from the supraduodenal artery.
Embolization of the GDA was performed with coils, from distal to proximal, across the supraduodenal artery.

Embolization was performed with Gelfoam powders via the LHA, and then the PHA.
The follow-up CHA and SMA angiography showed no more active bleeding.
The sheath will be kept for 24 hours for use if other bleeding episode occurs.

RECOMMENDATION:
Sandbag compression on the puncture site for at least 4 hours, and bed rest for 8 hours.
Close follow up the vital signs and consciousness.

Close f/u patient's vital signs.
Sandbag compression for at least 4 hours, and bed rest for 8 hours.
IA infusion of Vasopressin (4U per hour for 5 hours; if further bleeding, repeat q6h in maximal 24 hours)

The right femoral sheath can be removed if no more bleeding after 24 hours.
Then, sandbag compression for at least 4 hours, and bed rest for 8 hours.

PLAN:
Remove the right femoral sheath if no more bleeding after 24 hours.
Then, sandbag compression for at least 4 hours, and bed rest for 8 hours.

TACE for HCC

Operator: I-Ta Tsai
Anesthesia: local
Approach: right femoral artery
Catheters: 5Fr sheath, 4Fr RC1, 2.7Fr Progreat
Catheters: 5Fr sheath, 4Fr RC1, 2.5Fr Cantata
Catheters: 5Fr sheath, 5Fr RIM, 2.7Fr Progreat
Embolizer: Doxorubicin, Lipiodol, Gelfoam powders

PROCEDURE:
The angiography of celiac trunk shows tumor stain at S6 of liver.
The portal veins are patent in both celiac and superior mesenteric angiography.
Superselective embolization of the S6 hepatic arterial branch was performed with mixture of 20 mg Doxorubicin and 10 ml Lipiodol, followed by Gelfoam powders.
The follow-up RHA angiography showed no more tumor stain.
The sheath was then removed. Hemostasis was achieved by manual compression.

RECOMMENDATION:
Sandbag compression on the puncture site for at least 4 hours, and bed rest for 8 hours.
Close follow up the vital signs and consciousness.

OTHERS:
The liver was displaced medially, suggestive of ascites or hemoperitoneum.
The tumor stain shows irregularity and venous pools at the inferior portion. Recent tumor rupture may be suspected.

# Lipiodol
SMA, celiac, superselective hepatic angiograms and TAE are performed via puncture of right femoral artery. The whole procedure was smooth.
The aim of this procedure is to perform arterial embolozation for treatment of HCC.

1. A case of HCC s/p  .
2. hypervascular tumor stain(s) in   lobe of liver, consistent with HCC.
3. The portal vein was patent.
4. TAE with Lipiodol   ml and some gelfoam pieces injection into RHA.
5. Another  ml Lipiodol and some gelfoam pieces injection into LHA.
6. Suggest follow up this patient as TAE protocol.

# DC bead
Celiac, superselective hepatic angiograms and TACE are performed via puncture of right femoral artery. The whole procedure was smooth.
The aim of this procedure is to perform deTACE for HCC.

1. A case of HCC s/p deTACE*2.
2. Several large poor-defined hypervascular tumor stains at right lobe of liver.
3. The portal vein was patent.
4. extrahepatic tumor feedings from the LGA and RT phrenic artery (from right superior renal and adrenal arteries) were noticed. The LGA was embolized with glue.
5. The RT phrenic artery angiography was performed to exclude apparent pulmonary shunting, and thent deTACE with DC bead (300-500 um) 2cc+ epirubicin 75 mg was slowly injected, followed by gelfoam pieces until flow stasis.
6. deTACE with DC bead (100-300um) 2cc + epirubicin 75 mg was slowly injected into each segmental branches of the RHA.

After local anesthesia, a 18-G needle was introduced to the dilated calyx.
Clear light yellow urine was sampled, and sent back to ward for examination.
Under fluoroscopy guidance and using Seldinger's technique, a 8-Fr pigtail drain was placed into the renal pelvis.
Its patency was confirmed, and then, the drain was fixed with Nylon at external mark 18 cm.
