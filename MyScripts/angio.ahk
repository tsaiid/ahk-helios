TAE for bleeding

Operator: I-Ta Tsai
Anesthesia: local
Approach: right femoral artery
Catheters: 5Fr sheath, 4Fr RC1, 2.7Fr Progreat
Catheters: 5Fr sheath, 4Fr RC1, 2.5Fr Cantata
Catheters: 4Fr sheath, 4Fr J-Curve
Embolizer: Gelfoam powders
Embolizer: .018 3/2 Tornado microcoil, Gelfoam powders
Embolizer: Glue (NBCA/lipiodol = 1:4)

PROCEDURE:
The angiography of right renal artery showed active bleeding from the inferior adrenal artery.
TAE with a microcoil followed by Gelfoam powders was performed successfully.
The sheath and catheter were removed, and hemostasis of the puncture sire was achieved by manual compression.

The angiography of celiac trunk, followed by gastroduodenal artery, showed active bleeding from the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery.
Embolization was performed with Glue (NBCA/lipiodol = 1:4).
The follow-up GDA and SMA angiography showed no more active bleeding.
The sheath will be kept for 24 hours for use if other bleeding episode occurs.

The angiography of celiac trunk, followed by proper hepatic artery, showed a hypervascular mass at left lobe of liver, supplied mainly by the left hepatic artery, and active bleeding from the tumor vessels.
Embolization was performed with Gelfoam powders via the LHA, and then the PHA.
The follow-up CHA and SMA angiography showed no more active bleeding.
The sheath will be kept for 24 hours for use if other bleeding episode occurs.

RECOMMENDATION:
Close f/u patient's vital signs.
Sandbag compression for at least 4 hours, and bed rest for 8 hours.
IA infusion of Vasopressin (4U per hour for 5 hours; if further bleeding, repeat q6h in maximal 24 hours)

PLAN:
Remove the right femoral sheath if no more bleeding after 24 hours.
Then, sandbag compression for at least 4 hours, and bed rest for 8 hours.

Percutaneous Nephrostomy

Operator: I-Ta Tsai
Anesthesia: local

PROCEDURE:
Under sonography guidance, the kidney was localized.
The skin was prepared and the area was draped.
After local anesthesia, a 18-G needle was introduced to the dilated calyx.
Clear light yellow urine was sampled, and sent back to ward for examination.
Under fluoroscopy guidance and using Seldinger's technique, a 8-Fr pigtail drain was placed into the renal pelvis.
Its patency was confirmed, and then, the drain was fixed with Nylon at external mark 18 cm.
The whole procedure was smooth, the patient tolerated well, and no immediate complication was noted.
