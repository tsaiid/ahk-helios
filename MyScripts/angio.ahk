TAE for bleeding

Operator: I-Ta Tsai
Anesthesia: local
Approach: right femoral artery
Catheters: 5Fr sheath, 4Fr RC1, 2.7Fr Progreat
Catheters: 5Fr sheath, 4Fr RC1, 2.5Fr Cantata
Embolizer: .018 3/2 Tornado microcoil, Gelfoam powders
Embolizer: Glue (NBCA/lipiodol = 1:4)

PROCEDURE:
The angiography of right renal artery showed active bleeding from the inferior adrenal artery.
TAE with a microcoil followed by Gelfoam powders was performed successfully.
The sheath and catheter were removed, and hemostasis of the puncture sire was achieved by manual compression.

The angiography of celiac trunk, followed by gastroduodenal artery, showed active bleeding from the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery.
Embolization was performed with Glue (NBCA/lipiodol = 1:4).
The follow-up GDA and SMA angiography showed no more active bleeding.
The sheath will be kept for 24 hours for use if other bleeding episode occurs.

RECOMMENDATION:
Close f/u patient's vital signs.
Sandbag compression for at least 4 hours, and bed rest for 8 hours.
IA infusion of Vasopressin (4U per hour for 5 hours; if further bleeding, repeat q6h in maximal 24 hours)

PLAN:
Remove the right femoral sheath if no more bleeding after 24 hours.
Then, sandbag compression for at least 4 hours, and bed rest for 8 hours.
