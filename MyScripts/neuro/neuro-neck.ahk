COMPARISON:

FINDINGS:
Bilateral tonsillar enlargement, touching in the midline forming "kissing tonsils".
Small low density within the right tonsil.
Acute tonsillitis with abscess formation is considered.

Mild left tonsillar enlargement.
Multilocular fluid accumulation at left peritonsillar region, with rim enhancement, size about 3 cm, c/w peritonsillar abscesses.
They extend from oropharyngeal to hypopharyngeal level.

The lingual tonsils also show enlargement.
Symmetrical enlargement of the roof and posterior wall of the nasopharynx, suggestive of adenoid hyperplasia, probably related to the acute inflammation.

Cervical nodes:
Multiple enlarged lymph nodes over the bilateral carotid spaces, posterior cervical spaces, in favor of reactive lymph nodes. Suggest follow-up.
No evidence of bulky lymph nodes over bilateral supraclavicular fossae, bilateral submandibular and submental space.
Several enlarged lymph nodes over the bilateral carotid spaces, probably reactive lymph nodes.
