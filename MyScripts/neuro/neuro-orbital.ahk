Non-contrast CT scan of orbit

TECHNIQUE:
Slice thickness: 2-2 mm
Plane: axial, coronal, oblique sagittal

PREVIOUS CT of orbit: no

FINDINGS:
- Mild bilateral proptosis.
- Symmetrical enlargement of bilateral extraocular muscles, especially inferior rectus, medial rectus, superior rectus, with sparing the anterior tendon, c/w thyroid-associated orbitopathy.

- Exophthalmos at left side.
- Enlargement of left inferior rectus muscle, with sparing the anterior tendon, c/w thyroid-associated orbitopathy. However, due to it's unilateral and asymmetrical, orbital pseudotumor may also be considered. Suggest correlate with thyroid function test.

- No evident fracture of bilateral orbits.
- Symmetrical size of bilateral orbital retroocular optic nerves.
- The paranasal sinuses are clear.

Noncontrast CT scan and post contrast CT scan of the orbit performed with axial and coronal section, 2-2mm slice thickness showed:

Previous CT of orbit: no

FINDINGS:

Symmetrical bil. rectus muscle without enlargement of rectus muscle noted, no CT evidence of thyroid related ophthalmopathy.

Symmetrical bil. retrobulbar fat was noted.

No CT evidence of space occupying lesion over orbital, retro-ocular, sella, suprasellar regions.

No obvious soft tissue density over bilateral frontal sinus, sphenoid sinus, ethmoid sinus, maxillary sinus.

Presence of mild exophthalmos of left eye.

Presence of soft tissue thickening over nasophranyx, with bone erosion of the anterior portion of clivus, nasopharynx lesion should be R/O, suggest ENT check up.

Presence of dental artifact and superimpose of the oral cavity, and the oral cavity cannot be well evaluated. Film interpretation is limited.

Symmetrical bil. rectus muscle without enlargement of rectus muscle noted, no CT evidence of thyroid related ophthalmopathy.

No CT evidence of space occupying lesion over orbital, retro-ocular, sella, suprasellar regions.

Others as above descriptions.

SUGGESTION:
Follow up or further evaluation.
